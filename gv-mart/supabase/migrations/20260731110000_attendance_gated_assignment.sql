-- Technician Module Audit, Task 1: attendance must gate same-day/undated
-- auto-assignment. Root cause found while auditing _auto_assign_ticket_internal
-- (currently live in 20260730130000_assignment_zone_and_active_fix.sql):
--
-- `technicians.is_on_duty` exists but nothing in the live app ever sets it
-- true (confirmed by grepping every migration + every src/** write site —
-- only the deactivation trigger forces it false, and test-seed data is the
-- only place that ever sets it true). The engine's eligibility clause was:
--
--   (scheduled_at is null or scheduled_at::date <= current_date or t.is_on_duty = true)
--
-- which is vacuously true for same-day/undated appointments regardless of
-- is_on_duty — i.e. the exact case that matters (today's dispatch) was never
-- actually gated by attendance/duty status at all. Only genuinely
-- future-dated appointments were ever gated (by the technician_availability
-- roster check in the very next clause, unrelated to is_on_duty).
--
-- Fix: query `attendance` directly for today's date instead of trusting a
-- column nothing ever populates. This is the root-cause fix rather than
-- wiring is_on_duty to attendance via a trigger — a trigger-fed flag would
-- need its own day-rollover handling (when does "on duty" reset for a new
-- day?) that a direct date-scoped EXISTS avoids entirely. Future-dated
-- appointments correctly stay exempt from this (a technician can't have
-- checked in for a day that hasn't arrived yet) and keep using the existing
-- technician_availability roster check untouched.
--
-- "Present" = has a today's attendance row with check_in_at set and
-- check_out_at still null (checking out for the day removes eligibility for
-- further same-day auto-assignment, matching the requirement that offline/
-- day-ended technicians shouldn't receive new work).
--
-- Everything else in the function (is_active hard-exclude, zone removal,
-- skill/capacity filters, ranking) is untouched — verbatim copy except for
-- the one clause below.
